# webgl-unity-tutorial
Learning project for Udemy Course: Webgl with Unity the Ultimate Guide to Games in the Browser .

There are three main scenes in this project.  
1) A custom test project that simply spawns coins on a timer and keeps track of how many the player has clicked.
2) An image search application which queries the pixabay api and sets the background of the scene to an image.
3) A flappy bird game pulled from the Unity Asset store with click to flap functionality built into the web page.
